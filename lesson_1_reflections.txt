How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Enables user to quickly see new changes, intentional or not.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Enables user to quickly restore previous save point and recover any progress that may be lost.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: user has control over when to make commit and save progress.

Con: automatic saving could occur in meaningless points (i.e. middle of writing a line)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Depends on the requirements of the project. If project relies on the interaction between several files (e.g. HTML, CSS, JS files), Git is the more appropriate choice.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives overview of historical commits
git diff can be used to compare specific changes that occured between two commits using commit IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control allows you to quickly restore to a previous save/commit point with git checkout (commitID).

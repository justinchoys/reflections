When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using remote repository allows people to work together simultanteously.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be in the middle of writing a program, and pulling changes automatically may causes conflicts and unwanted side-effects.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using remote repository allows people to work together simultanteously.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be in the middle of writing a program, and pulling changes automatically may causes conflicts and unwanted side-effects.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of remotes between repositories stored on GitHub. Clones are local copies of remotes. Branches are labels for commits within the local repositories.

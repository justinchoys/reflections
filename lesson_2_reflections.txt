What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It greats a .git folder locally which contains meta-data about the files in that directory. This begins the version control tracking system which will then allow the user to make commits and save progress.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows you to control which files to include in the commit. Files that are not in the staging area before a commit is made is not saved as part of the commit. This allows users to control what changes to be part of one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

User can add/remove modified files from staging area to control what files are saved in each commit.
